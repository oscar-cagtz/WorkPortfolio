# Work Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub work portfolio! This repository showcases various projects and code samples that demonstrate my skills and progress in different programming languages. It serves as a platform for recruiters and collaborators to explore my work, track my development in each language, and understand the range of my expertise.

## Introduction

This is the work portfolio of **Oscar Alberto Carre√±o Gutierrez**, I am an embedded software/systems engineer with over 5 1/2 years of industry experience in the software world. 

I am a passionate and dedicated developer with experience in multiple programming languages and technologies. My main skills are related to the embedded world, specifically related to C/C++, but this repository is planned as a recollection for all the work and side projects I've done in different programming/scripting languages.

This portfolio spans various projects that highlight my ability to learn, adapt, and innovate. Below, you will find tables summarizing my progress and proficiency in each programming language, helping you understand what to look for as you explore my work.

## Progress Overview

PSA (January 20th, 2025): As of today, my main focus is centered mainly in C, with future learning focused on Go, Python and Switft. Other languages will be added out of the _Pending Languages_ folder once the main languages feel as having sufficient effort put into them, I'm leaving them in the README as a TBD section.
